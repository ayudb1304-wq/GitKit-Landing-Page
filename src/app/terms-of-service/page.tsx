            <h3 className="mt-6 mb-3 text-lg font-semibold text-zinc-300">2.1 What You CAN Do (Permitted Use)</h3>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Personal Projects:</strong> You may use the Codebase to build unlimited applications for your own personal use.</li>
              <li><strong>Commercial Projects:</strong> You may use the Codebase to build unlimited commercial Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, websites, or digital products where the end-user is a customer of that application.</li>
              <li><strong>Client Work:</strong> You may use the Codebase to build applications for clients, provided ownership of the final built application is transferred to the client, but the source code license remains with you (or the client purchases their own license).</li>

              <li><strong>No &quot;Wrapper&quot; Competitors:</strong> You cannot use the Codebase to create a product that directly competes with GitKit by offering a similar &quot;starter kit&quot; or &quot;boilerplate&quot; value proposition.</li>
